              I am a dedicated and detail-oriented Frontend Web Developer with a
              passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web
              applications. With 1.5 year of hands-on frontend experience and 3
              years overall in the tech industry, Iâ€™ve worked with technologies
              like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and
              TypeScript. My journey into web development began with a curiosity
              for how digital experiences are crafted, evolving into a focused
              career where I thrive on solving UI challenges and delivering
              seamless user interfaces. I enjoy collaborating with
              cross-functional teams, continuously learning new tools, and
              pushing the boundaries of modern web design. Outside of coding, I
              stay active as a state-level boxer, explore new frontend trends,
              and enjoy working on personal projects that sharpen my skills.
